    <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
    <p>Blueberry Pierogi are classic Polish dumplings filled with real summer gems: sweet, juicy blueberries, fresh off the bush. A dollop of sweetened cream balances the acidity of the fruit beautifully. Serve them for lunch or as a scrumptious dessert. </p>
    <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>For the dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 US cups (500 g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (8.45 fl oz, 250 ml) hot milk (or mix half n' half with hot water)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
<p><strong>For the blueberry filling</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups (7 oz, 200 g) blueberries or bilberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> For the toppings</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>sweetened cream, 12% or 18%</li>
    <li>a pinch of icing / powdered sugar, to sprinkle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Sift the flour, make a well in the flour dome. Pour in a small amount of hot milk and mix it in. Knead rapidly, continually adding enough milk to get a soft, elastic dough. </li>
    <li>Divide the dough into a few parts. Spread the first part of the dough on a floured worktop.</li>
    <li>Use the rolling pin, roll into a thin piece of dough. Cut the dough using a glass or a round cutter.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Blueberry Filling</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse fresh blueberries under a gentle stream of water.</li>
    <li>When using frozen berries, remove them from the freezer just before making pierogi (dumplings are easier to put together with frozen fruit).</li>
    <li>Dry on paper towels, spread on a tray and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of flour.</li>
    <li>Place one teaspoon of blueberries in the middle of each dough circle. Fold dough over filling, press edges together. Continue until you're out of dough and blueberries.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Finishing Up</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. </li>
    <li>Drop dumplings in and cook for 5 to 6 minutes - until they start to float.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, prepare some sweetened cream. Place some cream in a bowl, add some icing/powdered sugar, mix it in. Have a taste - is it sweet enough? If not, add more sugar and repeat.</li>
    <li>Remove pierogi from the pot with a slotted spoon. Serve on the plates and top with sweetened cream.</li>
</ol>
<p>ENJOY! <b>SMACZNEGO!</b></p>
